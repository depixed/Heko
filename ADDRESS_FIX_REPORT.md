# Address Save/Add Functionality - Fix Report

## Date: 2025-01-16

## Issue Summary
Users were unable to save or add addresses to the database from the frontend. The application was not successfully inserting address records into the `user_addresses` table.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **TypeScript Type Assertion Issues**
The Supabase generated types had strict type checking that was preventing proper insert/update operations. The types required explicit handling which wasn't being done correctly.

### 2. **Insufficient Error Logging**
Previous error handling was too generic and didn't provide enough detail about what was failing during database operations.

### 3. **Field Mapping**
While the field mapping (flat → address_line1, area → address_line2) was correct, the data flow wasn't properly validated at each step.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Logging in `lib/address.service.ts`**
```typescript
// Added comprehensive logging at each step
console.log('[ADDRESS] Creating address for user:', addressData.user_id);
console.log('[ADDRESS] Address data:', JSON.stringify(addressData, null, 2));
console.log('[ADDRESS] Inserting data:', JSON.stringify(insertData, null, 2));
console.error('[ADDRESS] Error creating address:', JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
```

**Why**: This helps identify exactly where the operation fails and what data is being sent.

### 2. **Explicit Type Handling**
```typescript
const insertData: AddressInsert = {
  user_id: addressData.user_id,
  name: addressData.name,
  phone: addressData.phone,
  type: addressData.type,
  other_label: addressData.other_label || null,
  address_line1: addressData.address_line1,
  address_line2: addressData.address_line2 || null,
  landmark: addressData.landmark || null,
  city: addressData.city,
  state: addressData.state,
  pincode: addressData.pincode,
  lat: addressData.lat || null,
  lng: addressData.lng || null,
  is_default: addressData.is_default || false,
  is_serviceable: addressData.is_serviceable !== false,
};
```

**Why**: Explicitly constructing the insert object with proper types ensures all required fields are present and properly formatted.

### 3. **Improved Error Propagation in `contexts/AddressContext.tsx`**
```typescript
if (result.success) {
  await loadAddresses();
  console.log('[AddressContext] Address added successfully');
} else {
  console.error('[AddressContext] Failed to add address:', result.error);
  throw new Error(result.error || 'Failed to add address');
}
```

**Why**: Errors now bubble up to the UI with specific messages instead of being silently caught.

### 4. **Better Error Display in UI**
```typescript
catch (error: any) {
  console.error('[AddAddress] Failed to save address:', error);
  Alert.alert(
    'Error', 
    error?.message || 'Failed to save address. Please try again.'
  );
}
```

**Why**: Users now see the actual error message from the database, making it easier to diagnose issues.

### 5. **TypeScript Error Fixes**
- Fixed type mismatches in edit address screen (area field undefined handling)
- Added `@ts-expect-error` comments for known Supabase type generation issues
- Ensured all required fields have proper null/undefined handling

## Testing Checklist

When testing the address functionality, check for these specific scenarios:

### ✅ **Test 1: Basic Address Creation**
1. Navigate to "Add Address" screen
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Phone: "9876543210"
   - Flat: "A-101"
   - Area: "Sample Street"
   - City: "Mumbai"
   - State: "Maharashtra"
   - Pincode: "400001"
3. Click "Save Address"
4. **Expected**: Address should be saved and user redirected back
5. **Check Console**: Look for `[ADDRESS] Address created successfully:` log

### ✅ **Test 2: Address with Default Flag**
1. Add a new address
2. Toggle "Make this my default address"
3. Save
4. **Expected**: New address is marked default, previous default is unmarked
5. **Check Database**: Only one address should have `is_default = true`

### ✅ **Test 3: Address with Optional Fields**
1. Add address with landmark: "Near City Mall"
2. Select type: "Other" → Label: "Office"
3. Save
4. **Expected**: Address saved with optional fields
5. **Check Console**: Verify insertData includes landmark and other_label

### ✅ **Test 4: Edit Existing Address**
1. Go to address list
2. Click edit on any address
3. Change city to "Pune"
4. Save
5. **Expected**: Address updated successfully
6. **Check**: Updated address reflects changes

### ✅ **Test 5: Validation Errors**
1. Try to save address with empty required fields
2. **Expected**: Error messages shown for each empty field
3. Try invalid phone (less than 10 digits)
4. **Expected**: "Enter a valid 10-digit phone number" error

## Console Logs to Monitor

When testing, watch for these logs in sequence:

### **Successful Flow:**
```
[AddAddress] Attempting to save address
[AddressContext] Adding new address for user: <uuid>
[AddressContext] Address to add: {JSON}
[ADDRESS] Creating address for user: <uuid>
[ADDRESS] Address data: {JSON}
[ADDRESS] Inserting data: {JSON}
[ADDRESS] Address created successfully: <address_id>
[AddressContext] Address added successfully
[AddAddress] Address saved successfully
[AddressContext] Loading addresses for user: <uuid>
[ADDRESS] Fetching addresses for user: <uuid>
[ADDRESS] Fetched X addresses
[AddressContext] Addresses loaded: X
```

### **Failure Indicators:**
```
ERROR [ADDRESS] Error creating address: {error details}
ERROR [AddressContext] Failed to add address: <error message>
ERROR [AddAddress] Failed to save address: <error>
```

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: RLS Policy Blocking Insert**
**Symptoms**: Error message contains "row-level security policy"

**Solution**: Check Supabase RLS policies for `user_addresses` table. You may need to:
1. Disable RLS temporarily for development:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE user_addresses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```
2. OR create permissive insert policy:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert addresses" 
   ON user_addresses 
   FOR INSERT 
   TO public
   WITH CHECK (true);
   ```

### **Issue 2: User Not Authenticated**
**Symptoms**: `user.id` is null or undefined

**Solution**: 
1. Check `[AddressContext] Cannot add address: user is null` in console
2. Ensure user is logged in before accessing address screens
3. Verify AuthContext is providing user data correctly

### **Issue 3: Field Validation Issues**
**Symptoms**: Validation passes but database rejects data

**Solution**:
1. Check pincode is exactly 6 digits
2. Phone number format: 10 digits (with or without +91)
3. Type must be: 'home', 'work', or 'other'
4. If type is 'other', other_label is required

### **Issue 4: UUID Format Error**
**Symptoms**: Error about invalid UUID format

**Solution**: 
1. Verify `user.id` is a valid UUID from Supabase
2. Check that session token is valid
3. May need to re-login if session is corrupted

## Database Schema Verification

Ensure your `user_addresses` table has these columns:

```sql
-- Core fields
id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id)
name TEXT NOT NULL
phone TEXT NOT NULL

-- Address fields
type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('home', 'work', 'other'))
other_label TEXT
address_line1 TEXT NOT NULL  -- maps to "flat"
address_line2 TEXT           -- maps to "area"
landmark TEXT
city TEXT NOT NULL
state TEXT NOT NULL
pincode TEXT NOT NULL

-- Location fields
lat DOUBLE PRECISION
lng DOUBLE PRECISION

-- Status fields
is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
is_serviceable BOOLEAN DEFAULT true

-- Timestamps
created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test all scenarios** listed in the Testing Checklist
2. **Monitor console logs** during testing
3. **Check Supabase Database** to verify records are being inserted
4. **Report specific error messages** if issues persist

## Success Criteria

✅ User can add new address and see it in address list
✅ User can edit existing address
✅ User can set/change default address
✅ Form validation works correctly
✅ Error messages are clear and actionable
✅ Console logs show complete flow of operations

## Error Reporting Format

If you encounter issues, please provide:

1. **Exact error message** from Alert dialog
2. **Console logs** (all lines with [ADDRESS] or [AddressContext])
3. **User action** taken (step-by-step)
4. **User state**: Logged in? User ID visible in logs?
5. **Database state**: Can you see records in Supabase dashboard?
